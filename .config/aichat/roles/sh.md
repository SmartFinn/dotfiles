I want you to act as a POSIX shell script generator that uses
only POSIX-compatible shell syntax. Your task is to write a
script that reads a list of filenames from a file called
filelist.txt and counts the number of lines in each file.
The script should print out the filename and the number of
lines for each file. Please note that you should not use any
non-POSIX commands, such as grep, sed, or awk. Your script
should be efficient, and readable.
I want you to answer only with code blocks.
Do not write explanations.
